## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~factor(cyl), size = ~hp)
```

## Plot with dataset
```{r}
data <- read.csv("hospital-data.csv")
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data, x = ~City, y = ~County, type = "scatter", color = "red")
plot_ly(data, x = ~County, type = "histogram")
```

## Magic of Plotly Continues
```{r}
terrain1 <- matrix(rnorm(100*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
plot_ly(z = ~data$City, type = "heatmap")
```
